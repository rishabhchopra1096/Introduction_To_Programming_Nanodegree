          <h1>THE BASICS OF WEB</h1>
            <p>   World Wide Web :<br>
              The web is a collection of HTML documents . -> these documents are made up of HyperTextMarkupLanguage.<br>
              HTML is the basis for all web.<br>
              Links between the pages is what makes the web , web like --> these are known as Hyper Links.<br>
              HTML glues the internet together. There may be images , other things but HTML is what hold the web together.<br>
              Quiz- Main type of document on the web -> HTML<br>
              What types of files can be found on the web  ?
              Plain text ,HTML , Images , Videos , Music.
            </p>
          <h2>MAJOR PIECES OF THE WEB</h2>
            <p>
              i) You<br>ii) Your Computer+Browser<br>iii) The Internet (Cloud)<br>iv) Servers<br>
            Your browser makes requests via the internet to the servers using a protocol called HTTP.<br>-> Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.->The main protocol of the web.<br>
            The servers respond with files that your browser displays.<br>
            Servers are just like computers , they are just optimized for hosting files rather than browsing these files.<br>
            Browser -> a program that runs on your computer to display files.</p>
          <h3>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</h3>
          <p>
               <b><em>Is made up of</em></b> :<br>
               ->text content <b>what you see</b> --> &lt;b&gt; used here<br>
               ->markup <b>what it looks like</b> --> &lt;b&gt; used here<br>
               ->references to other documents eg: images + videos <br>
               ->links to other pages<br>
               Now , plain text in the in a text editor is the same plain text in the browser.<br>
               For HTML markups -> you have to use tags -><br>
               &lt;name&gt; Contents&lt;/name&gt; <br>
               opening tag and closing tag ->Now the name of tag remains the same -> but the closing tag has a <b>/</b>.<br>
               The whole thing - &lt;name&gt;Contents&lt;/name&gt; refers to an <b>element.</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>The &lt;b&gt; tag </b>  :<br>
              Anything that appears inside the b tag -> appears <b>BOLD</b>. <br>
              &lt;b&gt;contents&lt;/b&gt;
          </p>
            <p>
               <b>The &lt;em&gt; tag</b>  --> it stands for emphasis:<br> -> <em>ITALICIZES</em> the text.<br>
               &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
              If you <b>forget to put the closing tag</b> in any like -> <br>
              I am going to &lt;em&gt;learn to &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; HTML -> you will see that all of the text-> Learn onwards becomes italicized.<br>
              Why? Cause you open the tag but never closed it so the tag does not know where to stop. So it will appear like this { <em>learn to <b>love</b> HTML </em> }.
            </p>
            <p> <b> HTML Attributes :</b> <br>
              &lt;TAG ATTR=value&gt;contents&lt;/TAG&gt;<br>
              Anchor tag - &lt;a&gt; <br>
              &lt;a href="www.reddit.com"&gt;herp&lt;/a&gt;<br>
              <em>href</em> is the attribute name and <em>www.reddit .com</em> is the value.<br>
              If you render this in HTML , you would just see derp -> but actually it will be a link to reddit.com. <br>
              Anchors are for making links .<br>
              The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. If the href attribute is not present, the tag is not a hyperlink.<br>
              href stands for Hypertext Reference.
            </p>
            <p> <b> IMAGE TAG -> &lt;img&gt; </b> <br>
              &lt;img src="url" alt="text"&gt; <br>
              url - servers can search for the image. <br>
              Here , the alt refer to the text that is required to be displayed when the image does not load.<br>
              ->for broken request<br>
              ->for blind people<br>
              IMAGE TAG IS A VOID TAG ->  Has no content no does not require a closing tag. </p>
            <p>
              <b> BREAK LINE TAG -> &lt;br&gt; </b> <br>
              Now , for the WHITESPACE : <br>
              Text on <br>
              Multiple -> Text on multiple lines <br>
              Lines <br>
              &lt;br&gt; -> break line tag , void tag<br>
              Put this after any line you want to break. <br>
              For eg:<br> 1. This text is really <br>
              2. too long one line --> will appear as this text is really too long one line.But <br>
              1. This text is really &lt;br&gt; <br>
              2. too long one line -> will appear as:<br> This text is really<br>
                                                too long one line .
            </p>
            <p>
              <b> PARAGRAPH TAG -> &lt;p&gt; </b> <br>
              -> Creates space between paragraphs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b> It does not matter how much spacing you do between words</b>  - it will count as one space only. <br>
              A coder has to use break line tag or paragraph tag to seperate some subjects or provide clarity or neatness.<br>
              Break Line Tag is Inline Element and Paragraph Tag is Block Element.
            </p>
            <p>
               <b> BLOCK VS INLINE ELEMENTS </b> <br>
                1. Block-level Elements <br>
                A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br>
                Examples of block-level elements:<br>
                &lt;div&gt; -> What is a div tag?<br>
                HTML -> Div Element(s) The &lt;div&gt; tag is nothing more than a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections.<br> Web developers use &lt;div&gt; elements to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to many elements at once.<br>
                &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; <Br>
                &lt;p&gt; <br>
                &lt;form&gt; -> kind of like the paragraph tag , whats the difference? <br>
                The HTML &lt;form&gt; tag is used for creating a form for user input.<br>
                A form can contain textfields, checkboxes, radio-buttons and more. Forms are used to pass user-data to a specified URL.<br>
                Now , for the second type of elements <br>
                2. Inline Elements <br>
                An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
                This is an inline &lt;span&gt; element inside a paragraph.
                Examples of inline elements:
                &lt;span&gt; <br>
                &lt;a&gt; <br>
                &lt;img&gt; <br>
                &lt;b&gt; <br>
                &lt;em&gt;. <br>
                &lt;strong&gt; -> strong is another name for bold-inline tag. <br>
            </p>
              <p>
                <b> Container Elements </b> <br>
                1. Span Tag : &lt;span&gt; and<br> 2. Div Tag : &lt;div&gt; <br>
                Both can have content but the only difference between them is that : <br>
                &lt;span&gt; text &lt;/span&gt; is Inline <br>
                And &lt;div&gt;text&lt;div&gt; is block. <br>
                These do nothing but contain their content.
                And then CSS can be used to add styles to them ->
                &lt;span class="foo"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; <b>inline</b> <br>
                &lt;div class="bar‚Äù&gt;text&lt;/div&gt; <b>block</b> <br>
                Now , the br tag is an Inline tag cause actually it does not create a box on the screen , it just creates a new line. <br>
                Other block elements actually create an invisible box around the text.

              3.        &lt;head&gt;
              4.                &lt;title&gt;My Web Page!&lt;/title&gt;
              5.        &lt;/head&gt;
              6.        &lt;body&gt;
              7.                &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my personal web page!&lt;/h1&gt;
              8.                &lt;p&gt;
              9.                       I am a full stack web developer in San Francisco , CA

            <em><b>Let's disect this code a bit</b></em>:<br>
            1) The first line is something that should appear on every webpage you make. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; defines the type of <br>the document so the browser will render it correctly.<br>
            2) The &lt;html&gt; tag opens our document. Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.<br>
            3) The &lt;head&gt; tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page (this is what appears in <br>
            the top of your tab or browser window). Notice that the &lt;head&gt; tag is indented to a new level <br>
            because the &lt;html&gt; tag was opened but not closed (a new idea was started but not completed). <br>
            Moreso, the &lt;title&gt; tag is indented another level further (the &lt;head&gt; tag was opened but not closed).<br>
            4) The &lt;title&gt; tag is closed on the same line it was opened which we usually do if the content of a tag is short.<br>
             On the other hand, the &lt;head&gt; tag is closed on a different line. The closing tag is indented to the same level as the matching opening one.<br>
           </p>
           <b>Note:</b> <br> &lt;pre&gt; used above to show HTML document structure. <br>
           &amp;lt and &amp;gt used to display HTML tags.
